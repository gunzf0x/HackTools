# HTB Gobox

A simple script I made for [HackTheBox Gobox](https://www.hackthebox.com/machines/gobox) machine that abuses a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability to remotely execute commands. It will help me to remember how to use `regex` to filter results.

## Usage

```shell-session
python3 webshell.py '<command to execute>'
```
